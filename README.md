Turkish Checkers Game Engine Developed for Bachelors Thesis.


Minor parts are taken for this bachelor thesis project and accordingly changes are made to be able to make it work for Turkish Checkers game. All of the AI related codes are developed and implemented by me and nothing is taken, only the GUI and some game environment related parts are taken/changed.

Some of the game environment parts are taken from GitHub User: everestwitman
https://github.com/everestwitman/Pygame-Checkers/blob/master/checkers.py

Parts taken: 
GUI (Minor changes are made).
few parts from Class Graphic (Major changes made).
few parts from Class Game (Major changes made).
few parts from Class Board (Major changes made).

Even though the most of the namings can be same/similar most of the code inside is changed due to the games are not the same and it was not compatible with Turkish Checkers Game piece number, movement and other specific rules.
It is only used as starting point but major changes are made to be able to implement the Turkish Checkers Game engine and its AI players/Hybrid solution.
